`data/ngrams/all_words.json`: Run `allWordsParser.py` with the corresponding word history file in the `parsing` directory. This will overwrite `all_words.json`, so you do not need to clear `all_words.json` prior to running the script.

data/ngrams/words: Delete the existing `words` directory and make a new `words` directory in the `parsing` directory. Run `wordsParser.py` with the corresponding word history file in the `parsing` directory. This will fill the `words` directory.
